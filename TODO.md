# TODO

[VITEPRESS THEME COLORS](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress/blob/main/src/client/theme-default/styles/vars.css)

## to-do

### Spine widget

- [ ] Plus/Minus buttons that increment in multiples of the stitch height

- [ ] Other variants
    - [ ] "Whale" version
    - [ ] "Leaf" version
    - [ ] Basic circles
    - [ ] Circle coloring version

UX things:
- [ ] Arrowed ends
- [ ] Open/closed ends
- [ ] Starting and ending instructions
- [ ] ⏰ Stitch height vs. width
- [ ] ⏰ Only inc into non-inc'ed stitches?

- [X] Use the better single row function on the other widget
- [X] Make the picture not interactable
- [X] Orange line if slope too steep
- [X] Green line if the same distance
- [X] Should I move freeby stitch to the start?
- [X] transparency
- [X] starting stitches
- [X] Stuff instructions
- [X] Debugging chart (Relative sizes, cm sizes, stitches, instructions)
- [X] Set minimum rib distance
